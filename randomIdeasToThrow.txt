1. for every off-suit + spade:
couldMakeAFollowTrick

2. for spade:
couldMakeATrumpTrick

3.Save a card just to intimidate
------
2.
If no spade, couldMakeATrumpTrick = 0

If spade, don't think about it yet.

1.
If has master & is over other cards...
Nice (10/10)

If has KingEquiv and at least 1 other
AND there's 2+ other cards
Then something...(8/10)

If has Qequiv and at least 2 other and
there's 3+ other cards then something
if there's 2 other cards, then little something...
(6/10)

If opponents will lead and won't want to lead it, then less
(-2/10)??

If opponents can trump on it, then less
(-1/10)??

------------------

Save a card just to intimidate:


If kequiv and 0 other in hand
and others have 3-4+, then good.


If Qequiv and 0 or 1 other in hand
then 9/10...
and others have 3-4+, then ok.

TODO: convert rules into odds of winning a trick

The odds prob depend on the # of spades in other hands
and who's void
and who's signalling void.

-----

Getting started on logic for this:
If you only want 1 more trick:

Value:
1) couldMakeAFollowTrick
2) couldMakeATrumpTrick
and if partner isn't completely useless:
3) Save a card just to intimidate

(Value 1 and 2 equally, but ignore #3 for now)
