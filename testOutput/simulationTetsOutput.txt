Manual testing:

I put this in a notepad file and checked if
simulations align with it:

Michael:
JS 9S KH TH 5H QC TC 9C 7C 3C AD KD JD 

Phil:
AS TS 6S 5S 2S JH 9H 8H 6H AC JC 8C TD

Richard:
KS 8S 4S 3S QH 7H 4H 3H 2H 5C 2C 6D 3D

Doris: 
QS 7S AH KC 6C 4C QD 9D 8D 7D 5D 4D 2D

It's consistent!
At least one of the simulations is the set to the real way the cards are distributed.
