"This model was in fact produced by RiskSLIM, the Risk-Supersparse-Linear-Integer-Models algorithm (which we’ll also look at in more depth later this week)."

"A logical model just a bunch of if-then-else statements! These have been crafted by hand for a long time. The ideal logical model would have the smallest number of branches possible for a given level of accuracy. CORELS is a machine learning system designed to find such optimal logical models. Here’s an example output model that has similar accuracy to the blackbox COMPAS model on data from Broward County, Florida:"

Try them out. They imitate how I would manually program it.
